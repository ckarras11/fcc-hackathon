# SpareChange

## Description

This app was built for the 2018 Free Code Camp Hackathon by Christopher Karras and Dimo Ivanov. It is an app that keeps track of users expenses.

## API's Used

- Netlify Identity
- Hasura DB

## Technologies Used

- React
- GraphQL

## Challenges

This project was initally started with Gatsby but became very difficult with all of the updating that needed to take place. It was converted over to a Create-React-App project. Another main challenge was not being able to set custom payloads for JWT when using Netlify identity. This made it tough to send secure headers to Hasura. If we were doing this differently we would problably rethink our architecture.

## Final Thoughts

Overall we got a lot done in 2 days from an idea to a working application. There are still many things that should be improved on from performance to security but it is a great starting point.

## Installation Instructions

```
git clone

npm install

npm start
```
